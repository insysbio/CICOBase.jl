# Overview

**CICOBase** is a [Julia](https://julialang.org/downloads/) package for **identifiability analysis** and **confidence intervals** estimation.

## Use cases

Benchmarks and use cases can be found in a separate repository: <https://github.com/insysbio/likelihoodprofiler-cases>

## Installation


```julia
julia> ]

(v1.9) pkg> add CICOBase
```

## Quick start

```julia
using CICOBase

# testing profile function
f(x) = 5.0 + (x[1]-3.0)^2 + (x[1]-x[2]-1.0)^2 + 0*x[3]^2

# Calculate parameters intervals for first parameter component, x[1]
res_1 = get_interval(
  [3., 2., 2.1], # starting point
  1,             # index of parameter
  f,             # profile function
  :LIN_EXTRAPOL; # :QUADR_EXTRAPOL or :CICO_ONE_PASS
  loss_crit = 9. # likelihood confidence level
  )
#

# Plot parameter profile x[1]
using Plots
plotly()
plot(res_1)
```

## Intro

The reliability and predictability of a **kinetic systems biology (SB) and systems pharmacology (SP) model** depends on the calibration of model parameters. Experimental data can be insufficient to determine all the parameters unambiguously. This results in "non-identifiable" parameters and parameters identifiable within confidence intervals (CIs). The algorithms included in **CICOBase** implement Profile Likelihood (PL) [2] method for parameters identification and can be applied to complex SB models. The results of the algorithms can be used to qualify and calibrate parameters or to reduce the model.

## Objective

The package introduces several original algorithms. The default algorithm `:CICO_ONE_PASS` has been developed in accordance with the following principles:

- The algorithms don't require the likelihood function to be differentiable. Hence, derivative-free or global optimization methods can be used to estimate CI endpoints.
- The algorithms are designed to obtain CI endpoints and avoid the calculation of profiles as the most computationally expensive part of the analysis. 
- CI endpoints are estimates with some preset tolerance. Reasonable tolerance setup can also reduce the number of likelihood function calls and speed up the computations. 
- The algorithm are applicable for both finite and infinite CI.

## Methods overview

This algorithms can be applied to complex kinetic models where function differentiability is not guaranteed and each likelihood estimation is computationally expensive.  

The package introduces original "one-pass" algorithm: **Confidence Intervals evaluation by Constrained Optimization** [6]  `:CICO_ONE_PASS` developed by the authors of this package. `:CICO_ONE_PASS` utilizes the **Inequality-based Constrained Optimization** [3-4] for efficient determination of confidence intervals and detection of “non-identifiable” parameters.  

The "multi-pass" methods use extrapolation/interpolation of profile likelihood points: linear (`:LIN_EXTRAPOL`) and quadratic (`:QUADR_EXTRAPOL`) approaches. They are also efficient for both identifiable and non-identifiable parameters.
